# threaddownloader
A tool for downloading threads from 4chan

This tool uses wget and curl and thus you need to have those installed as dependencies. This is my first "actual" script that Im publishing, there may be some issues with it, but you're more than welcome to change it. Thank you!



/// Operation :

CD into the folder where you want the contents to download, this is mainly just to make sure you dont fill up your home folder with stuff (wget may have some issues and create folders, Im sure you can figure out where things get downloaded).

Run ``threaddownloader`` and make sure its in your path.
Copy and paste the thread URL
The thread shows off some neat seperation , but you can comment those lines out if you dont want it to show itself breaking down the link.

You then choose whether you want to download all of the contents to make an (almost, if not) perfect copy of the given thread, or if you want to download just content (images, videos, gifs). 

It'll go and download what you have requested.

Wait...

Congratulations ! You have downloaded a thread ! You have just one more step before you're done, you choose whether you want to delete the small preview versions of files (marked with an "s" at the end), or if you want to delete the preview versions. Typically there isn't really a point in downloading the preview versions too so I usually delete them.


Aaaand now you are done!
